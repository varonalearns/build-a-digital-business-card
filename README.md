# Build A Digital Business Card

This is my solution to Build A Digital Business Card lesson from The Frontend Developer Career Path that can be found on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned the basics of HTML5 and CSS3.

## Continued Development

As I learn more, I hope to revisit this project and add something to it. Perhaps a QR code that leads to my portfolio.
